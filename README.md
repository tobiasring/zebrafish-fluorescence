# zebrafish-fluorescence
This repository contains the matlab code that does the signal processing of embryonic zebrafish fluorescence. It has been used within the journal paper "Neurotransmitter-mediated activity spatially controls neuronal migration in the zebrafish cerebellum" on PLOS Biology. 

To run the code, run "process_fluorescence_data_main.m" in a MATLAB environment.
The code assumes all necessary data being available in subfolders, placed within the same folder as the code is placed. The data is not provided in this repository by now.
